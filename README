 This sketch shows two timers. One is user resettable and one is not. 
 The timers keep track of how long an analog input goes past a threshold.
 The smallest increment is one minute. If the threshold is exceeded for 
 any point in a minute (even less than a second) that minute is counted 
 towards the time.
 
  The circuit:
 * LCD RS pin to digital pin 12
 * LCD Enable pin to digital pin 11
 * LCD D4 pin to digital pin 5
 * LCD D5 pin to digital pin 4
 * LCD D6 pin to digital pin 3
 * LCD D7 pin to digital pin 2
 * LCD R/W pin to ground
 * 10K resistor:
 * ends to +5V and ground
 * wiper to LCD VO pin (pin 3)
 *
 * Analog input for thresholding analog in pin 0
 * button input for reset digital pin 13
